# Vim Tetris: Colour Pop

A game threefold in its intent to get used to certain vim keys, to teach (children?) about colours, and to teach me about making a game in JavaScript.

## Ideas

- Use vim keys instead of arrow keys for muscle memory
- Secondary colour creation when two primary colour blocks collide:
Blue and Yellow = Green
Yellow and Red = Orange
Red and Blue = Purple

# Setup

← To make API calls, run a local server via [one of these lines in the terminal](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) from the directory where `index.html` exists.
